# Code_Refactor
Modified HTML to meet accessibility standards. Updated proper semantic HTML elements, removed bad code, and cleaned up classes. Also updated CSS to remove bad code and organize in accordance with the HTML. Minor aesthetic changes to clean up UI.

Tested with NVDA screen reader to make sure it was easily navigable.
